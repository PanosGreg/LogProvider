# a) about the $Global:_DriveLogs variable:

# the  $_DriveLogs will be exposed to the end-user, but it won't be the same
# var as the one that the PSDrive will be using, for some reason
# Which means even if the end-user deletes the  $_DriveLogs var, or adds/removes
# any entries to/from it. These changes won't affect the var that the
# PSDrive is using. So essentially the  $_DriveLogs var that the end-user can access
# and the  $_DriveLogs var that the Provider accesses, are 2 different vars



b) about the Cache setting:

# I explicitly set the Cache to false, in order for SHiPS to
# re-instantiate the LogStream classes each time the user does "dir"
# so that the count will be calculated anew



c) about data persistence:

The data can persist in 2 ways:
   1) by setting the UseCache to true on the root class of the provider
      And then using a hidden property to store the data.
      BUT if the user runs "dir -force" on the root, then it will empty the cache
      so all the data written will be lost.

   2) by using a global variable on the top of the module, which can be accessed
      inside the classes. This way you don't need any hidden property nor do you
      need to use the cache setting.
